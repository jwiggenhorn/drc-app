## About The Project

The Digital Response Capture (DRC) project consists of this mobile application used for collecting real-time input data from a study participant, and a [web application](https://github.com/jwiggenhorn/drc-admin-panel) used to create the studies and view the collected participant data.

This project was developed by a group of four students at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville for the university's music department and was inspired by the Continuous Response Digital Interface, a hardware device historically used in music research.

The goal of this project is to give researchers a better way to measure and study certain responses to music in order to better understand how people feel, think about, and experience different aspects of music.

The DRC project is completely open-source and contributions towards its continued development and maintenance are welcome and encouraged.
